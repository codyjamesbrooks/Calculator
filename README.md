# Calculator
A Tkinter Calculator 

Wanted to learn Tkinter. So I created a functioning Tkinter Calculator. 
program operates as expected, included funtion buttons to do following
 - Convert percentage into decimal
 - Take Square root of number on screen
 - Square number on screen

I know of one bug with the program that I will log, to fix later. 
Also would like to add num pad functionality, but that isn't the point of this 
exercise today. 

Hopefully you enjoy my tkinter calculator. (Or at the very least it helps you solve super basic math problems)
